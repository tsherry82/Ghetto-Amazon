# Ghetto-Amazon

========================8/24==========================

building an application that resembles Amazon.com, it will take users orders and then deplete the stock from the database inventory

I will use mySQL to store the inventory on a database and then use inquirer to us the prompt to interact with the user

today I will focus on setting up the database and the connecting it to Node

==========================8/25============================

was able to finish up the database and then logging the products at the start of the application

today I will be working on the prompt to get the user input when select the item_id and the the quantity of their purchse

I also switched up the price int to be a decimal so I could give the products more realistic values, and also changed the item_id numbers as well to make it more authentic then having an auto incremented number
